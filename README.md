# Description

Web application is a weather dashboard that allows a user to search for the weather in a particular city.  After the search is submitted, the user is presented with the current day's forecast (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index) as well as the forecast for the next 5 days (temperature, humidity and wind speed).  For a quick glance, the user is also presented with an icon representation of the weather.  A search history saves previous city searches.  

Web application uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as the OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data).
